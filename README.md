## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence to enhance the 3D printing experience. By generating creative prompts or stories, it provides inspiration and guidance to users during the 3D printing process. The generated content can serve as a foundation for designing unique and intriguing 3D-printed objects.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Printing-AI-Assistants.git
      cd 3D-Printing-AI-Assistants


2. Set a Prompt for Generating the Story:
Open the generate_story.py file and modify the PROMPT variable to set your desired input for generating a story or prompt for your 3D printing project:

     ```python
     # Set your prompt for generating the story
     PROMPT = "Once upon a time, in a futuristic world, there was a magical object being 3D printed..."


3. Run the Python script to generate a story or promptThe script will generate a story based on the provided prompt:

     ```bash
     python generate_story.py
